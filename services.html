              <h3>Systems Engineering</h3>
              <p>
                At ConSysTec, nearly everything we do involves the use of the
                Systems Engineering process.
              </p>

              <p>
                All ITS projects involve risk. However, the Systems Engineering
                process provides a structured methodology for managing complex
                ITS systems. Our staff is highly qualified in the practice of
                Systems Engineering and have written guidance documents on
                applying systems engineering in ITS, developed systems
                engineering content for ITS standards, and performed systems
                engineering analysis for regional multi-modal systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                By helping navigate the Systems Engineering process, ConSysTec
                helps our clients reduce the risk involved in the project while
                adhering to FHWA and FTA policies. ConSysTec offers specific
				services related to Systems Engineering. These services include
				but are not limited to:
              </p>

                <li>
                  <b>● Systems Engineering Analysis for specific ITS Projects</b
                  ><br />
                  Systems Engineering is a process that breaks a project down
                  and puts it back together. This is done to ensure that the
                  correct system is being built and the system is being built
                  properly.
                  <br /><br />
                  With ConSysTec’s extensive experience in all phases of the
                  Systems Engineering process, including the development of
                  documentation (i.e., Concept of Operations, System
                  Requirements, System Design Specifications, Test Plans, etc.)
                  our clients can feel confident that the work is done right and
                  in conformance with federal guidelines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>● Prepare procurement documents</b><br />
                  Preparing concise, accurate and timely procurement documents
                  is crucial to the success of any ITS project. At ConSysTec, we
                  have extensive experience in helping our clients prepare
                  procurement documents which utilize the Systems Engineering
                  process to define the requirements for a system as specified
                  in a procurement specification.

                  ><br />
                  Our staff can independently develop test plans,
                  specifications, and procedures to verify that the system is
                  built properly and can validate that the proper system was
                  built. At ConSysTec, we feel that it is a best practice to
                  have testing performed by an independent reviewer.

			<h3>ITS Architectures</h3>
            <p>
              ConSysTec staff have had key roles on the U.S. National ITS Architecture
			  Program since its inception in 1993. As an industry leader in the
			  development of regional and statewide ITS architectures, ConSysTec
			  is proud to have played a key role in developing ITS architectures
			  for nearly 100 regions, states and countries.
            </p>

            <p>
              All regions of the United States with ITS projects using Federal
              funds MUST have a regional ITS Architecture. Within the United
              States, ConSysTec develops regional ITS architectures that conform
              to the U.S. National ITS Architecture. Our specialty is rapidly
              and accurately developing stakeholder consensus-based multi-modal
              ITS architectures that are usable.
            </p>

            <p>
              But why is an ITS Architecture needed? ITS Architectures provide a
              common basis for planners and engineers with differing concerns to
              conceive, design and implement systems using a common language as
              a basis for delivering an ITS project. Each regional ITS
              architecture accounts for that region's local needs, stakeholders,
              subsystems, ITS deployments, and institutional barriers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the years, we have pioneered methods of developing and
              representing ITS architectures that have delighted our many
              customers. As part of our standard ITS architecture services, our
              work is based on RAD-IT (Regional Architecture Development for
              Intelligent Transportation). Our webpages provide links between
              the ITS architecture and transportation plans; and shows how
              programmed ITS projects are represented in the ITS architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
              When an ITS Architecture is completed, our goal is for each
              stakeholder to agree that as they build out their ITS elements and
              projects, they will allow for interoperability, as well as, share
              information as shown in the customized regional ITS architecture.
              This is the “consensus” that ConSysTec strives to achieve in each
              regional ITS architecture we develop.
            </p>

			  <h3>ITS/CV Standards</h3>
              <p>
                ITS/CV standards are based on open, non-proprietary interfaces that
                can be used to facilitate the deployment of interoperable ITS
                systems. In addition, ITS Standards make it easier for state and
                local ITS deployers to develop and deploy integrated
                transportation systems. Deploying open standards reduces risk
                and costs in ITS projects, by supporting competition for ITS
                systems while providing a path for future expansion and
                upgrades.
              </p>
              <p>
                ConSysTec plays an active role in ITS/CV Standards and is a

                  ● Moving forward, the integration of GTFS with other Mobility standards, such as the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS), will empower travelers to coordinate many modes of transportation when planning their trips. The net result is improvement in transportation efficiency when it comes to accessibility, equity, and the promotion of multimodal services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ● We believe that Mobility on Demand and GTFS integration allows for the growth of Mobility Hubs that use real-time trip data across multiple Mobility modes, which will play a key role in revitalizing underserved neighborhoods and planning for smart cities of the future.

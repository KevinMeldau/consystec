          <h3>Our Company</h3>
          <p>
            ConSysTec is a DBE / MBE / SBE certified firm that is a leader in
			applying systems engineering to Intelligent Transportation
			Systems (ITS), with specialties in ITS Architectures; and ITS, 
			connected vehicles and mobility (including transit) standards.
          </p>

          <p>
            We develop Concept of Operations, Requirements documents, and
            Verification and Validation Plans for ITS projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of our leadership and participation in the development of the
            US DOT's National ITS Architecture and US ITS Standards, we have
            extensive expertise and experience that gives us a comprehensive
            understanding of both the technical and institutional issues
            associated with the development and deployment of regional ITS
            planning, as well as, deploying ITS technology solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since 2001, we have been driven by the desire to meet and exceed our
            customer's goals and objectives. We do this by engaging all possible
            stakeholders to gain a full understanding of their needs and desires
            on each specific project, so our priorities align exactly with those
            of the customer.

          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>
            Consensus Systems Technologies Corporation (ConSysTec) was founded
			in 2001 by Dr. Robert Jaffe and Bruce Eisenhart. At that time, the
			USDOT has just enacted the Final Rule and FTA Policy on ITS
			Architectures and Standards. This rule required the development of
			regional ITS architectures within four years for regions using
			federal funding for ITS projects. Due to their experience in
			developing the National ITS Architecture, ConSysTec was able to
			provide leadership throughout the nation in creating many regions'
			first ITS architectures. Our ITS architecture practice area has
			grown internationally, where we have developed ITS architectures
			spanning four continents.
          </p>

          <p>
            As our team grew, our practice grew into many areas with applying
            the systems engineering to ITS - we develop concept of operations
            and requirements documents for complex systems; develop, specify and
            test ITS standards. We provide services for the full lifecycle of an
            ITS system - except build, operate and maintain.

          <p>
            ConSysTec has solidified its leadership in the ITS community. We are
            experts in our field, and continue to expand our body of knowledge
            to better serve our customers.
